# Brief Descriptions of Projects (In Order of Completion)
1. **WeSplit**: A project that takes an amount paid, the number of people, and a tip percentage, and calculates the payment split between each person.
2. **UnitConverter**: A project that handles unit conversions, specifically **TIME CONVERSIONS**. Users choose a starting unit, ending unit, and input a quantity, and the app will handle the conversion. 
3. **GuessTheFlag**: A minigame that prompts the user to guess what the flag of a random country is. 
4. **RPSBrainTrain**: A minigame that has a CPU pick a random choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the user has to pick the corresponding choice that will WIN them or LOSE them the match. Project works but looks like shit and will be circled back to.
5. **BetterRest**: An app that uses machine learning to predict the optimal time for somebody to sleep is, given their desired amount of sleep, their coffee intake, and what time they want to wake up.
